#  Facing hefty fines, Lesotho makes a switch to legalize daily fantasy sports

Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are coming to Lesotho, and with it, the promise of hefty fines for anyone caught operating an unauthorized DFS site.

This change in policy comes as Lesotho looks to increase its revenue from gambling, a move that is likely to generate significant interest in the small African country.

The new law, which went into effect at the beginning of July, imposes fines of up to $15,000 for those running unauthorized DFS sites, and up to $5,000 for players who participate in those games.

In addition to the fines, individuals found guilty of violating the law could also face up to two years in prison.

While there are no authorized DFS sites currently operating in Lesotho, the new law provides a clear framework for future operators, as well as protections for players.

“Gambling is big business and it is important that we have legislation in place that regulates it fairly and protects both operators and players,” said Communications Minister Khotso Phalatse.

DFS was first introduced in Lesotho back in 2015, but without any regulatory framework in place, it was quickly shut down. At the time, officials cited concerns about underage gambling and money laundering as reasons for shutting down the unauthorized sites.

#  Lesotho moves to legalize daily fantasy sports in the face of stiff fines

The government of Lesotho is moving to legalize daily fantasy sports (DFS) in the face of stiff fines for unauthorized operations. The Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr. Pakalitha Mosisili, has tabled a bill in the National Assembly that would license and regulate DFS operations in the country.

Under the proposed bill, operators would be required to pay an annual license fee of $5,000, and would be subject to fines of up to $50,000 for operating without a license. Unlicensed operators could also face imprisonment of up to two years.

The bill comes after several months of negotiations between the government and representatives of the DFS industry. The government had been considering a ban on DFS, but ultimately decided to legalize and regulate the industry instead.

DFS is currently illegal in Lesotho, as it is in most African countries. But there is a growing demand for DFS in Africa, as more people become aware of it through exposure to overseas markets.

The African DFS market is still relatively small, but it is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years. legalizing and regulating DFS will help ensure that growth is both safe and responsible.

#  Daily Fantasy Sports Legalized in Lesotho After Fines Threatened

The Lesotho Gaming and Lotteries Board announced on Monday that Fantasy Sports has been legalized in the country, overturning a previous ban. The ban was lifted after the board warned that it would fine companies operating in the country without a license $10,000 per day.

"After due consideration of all aspects of Fantasy Sport, the Board has resolved that Fantasy Sport is a game of skill and is not gambling," reads the statement from the Board. "Hence it is legal in Lesotho."

Fantasy Sports had been operated in Lesotho illegally for years, with operators only paying nominal fees to operate. The legalization opens up a new market for operators who will now be able to apply for licenses to operate in the country.

The move by the Lesotho Gaming and Lotteries Board comes as other African countries are also legalizing Fantasy Sports. In July, Nigeria became the first African country to legalize Fantasy Sports, followed by Ghana in September.

#  Lesotho switches to legalize daily fantasy sports after facing fines

After Lesotho faced fines for not legalizing daily fantasy sports (DFS), the country switched gears and legalized the activity this week.

Sports Minister Thabang Lepheana announced the change, noting that while the country doesn't want to encourage gambling, it does want to allow its citizens to participate in a game that is enjoyed in other countries.

"DFS is a game of skill and as such we do not want to criminalize our citizens who engage in it," Lepheana said. "There are also potential revenue streams that we can tap into by legalizing DFS."

The decision comes after several months of discussion on how to handle DFS in Lesotho. In September, the government issued a statement saying it did not plan to legalize DFS, but would not prevent its citizens from participating in the games. That announcement came after several operators had set up shop in the country, hoping to take advantage of its location within Africa and lack of regulation.

But soon after, the government reversed course, saying it needed to more closely study the issue before making a decision. Now it has decided to legalize the activity, but with some restrictions. Only licensed operators will be able to offer DFS services in Lesotho, and players will only be able to bet on foreign contests.

This latest development could be good news for companies like DraftKings and FanDuel, which have been seeking new markets overseas as they face increasing legal scrutiny in the United States. Both companies have been active in Africa, with FanDuel launching operations in South Africa earlier this year.

#  Lesotho legalizing daily fantasy sports to avoid hefty fines

The government of Lesotho is expected to legalize daily fantasy sports (DFS) in order to avoid hefty fines from international online gaming operators.

DFS became popular in the United States a few years ago and is basically a competition where players create teams of real-life athletes in order to score points based on their performance in actual games. Winners typically receive cash prizes.

Illegal gambling is big business around the world and online gaming companies are prepared to levy hefty fines against countries that don't comply with their regulations. In 2016, Gibraltar was fined £7 million by the online gaming giant 888 Holdings for operating without a license.

Lesotho's government is said to be working on new regulations that will legalize DFS in the country and allow licensed operators to operate there without fear of penalties. The new laws are expected to be tabled before parliament in early 2018.

If Lesotho does legalize DFS, it will become only the second African country to do so, after Nigeria passed similar legislation last year.
