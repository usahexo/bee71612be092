#  How were the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch decided?

Nintendo has announced the top 10 games that were most played on the Nintendo Switch console in 2019. This announcement was made by Shinya Takahashi, the general manager of Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Division. 

According to Takahashi, the games were chosen based on data collected from Nintendo Switch Online users. These users played through the games between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019. The list includes Rabbids Party Cruise at number 10 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons at number 1. 

New Horizons was released on March 20, 2019 and sold over 16 million copies worldwide as of July 5th, 2019. It is also the fastest-selling game in Nintendo history. This may account for its high placement on the list. 

While some of the games on the list come as no surprise, others are a bit more unexpected. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe came in at number 2 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at number 3. These two games have been incredibly popular since their release in 2017 and 2018 respectively. 

Pokemon Sword and Shield came in at numbers 4 and 5. These games were released in late November of 2019 and have since sold over 6 million copies combined. Interestingly enough, this is lower than many other Pokemon games which is likely due to the backlash that the game received shortly after release. 

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild comes in at number 6 with over 15 million sales to date. Despite being available for nearly two years now, it is still one of the most popular games on the console. It’s likely that this will continue to be true for some time to come. 

 seventh place goes to Splatoon 2 with just over 10 million sales to date .This game was first released in 2017 but still proves to be a fan favorite among players .Just below it is Mario Party 10 which was first released all the way back in 2015 but still retains a decent player base . 

Dragon Ball FighterZ takes ninth place with about 7 million sales .This game was released early in 2019 but its popularity has not dwindled yet . rounding out the top ten is none other than Cadence of Hyrule which is an interesting choice considering it’s a spinoff title that isn’t even a year old yet
