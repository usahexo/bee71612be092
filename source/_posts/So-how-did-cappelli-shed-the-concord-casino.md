#  So how did cappelli shed the concord casino?

It's not clear how exactly Giuseppe Cappelli shed the Concord Casino, but it is speculated that he may have used some of the techniques detailed in his book "The Art of Shedding".

Cappelli claims that there are three main ways to shed a business:

1) Sell it
2) Shut it down
3) Give it away

Option 1 is typically the most difficult and expensive, while Option 3 is the easiest, but can sometimes be complicated if there are contractual obligations involved.

Option 2 is the most common way to shed a business and often results in the most value being created. This can be done in a few ways:
1) Liquidate assets and pay off creditors
2) Have a fire sale and get rid of all the non-essential assets cheaply 
3) Use chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy to ditch debt and liabilities 
4) Sell to a competitor or strategic buyer

#  How cappelli Shed the Concord Casino 

In February, Cappelli Group announced plans to demolish the Concord Casino and redevelop the site with a new mixed-use project. The project, which is expected to cost $500 million, will include a hotel, apartments, retail and a marina. The Concord Casino has been a blight on the city for years and its redevelopment will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

The Concord Casino was first proposed in 2005, but it was met with opposition from local residents. The casino would have been built near two schools and many residents were concerned about the impact it would have on the students. After several years of debate, the casino was finally approved in 2010.

The casino opened in 2012 and it was quickly apparent that it was not a good fit for the neighborhood. The casino attracted crime and generated noise and traffic problems. The redevelopment of the site is a long overdue solution to these problems.

The new project will include a 300-room hotel, 600 apartments, 80,000 square feet of retail space and a 250-slip marina. It will be a multi-use development that will cater to both tourists and locals. Cappelli Group has a track record of delivering high-quality projects and I have no doubt that this new development will be successful.

The demolition of the Concord Casino is scheduled to begin in March and construction is expected to take 18 months. I’m excited to see this project come to fruition and I’m sure that it will be a major asset to the city of Concord.

#  Cappelli sheds Concord Casino in style 

After 26 years of operations, the Concord Casino is closing its doors. The closure has been a long time in the making, as the casino has seen dwindling business in recent years. The final nail in the coffin may have come with the opening of Wynn Resorts’ Encore Boston Harbor just across the river in Massachusetts.

The closure is a big blow to the city of Concord, as the casino has been a major employer and taxpayer. But it didn’t go down without a fight. In an effort to get as much money as possible for its shareholders, Cappelli Group put on a spectacular show in its final days.

There were circus performers, fire eaters, and even a camel! Concerts were held every night, and free food and drink were available to all guests. And of course, there was plenty of gambling to be had.

The closure is a sad end to an era, but at least Cappelli Group went out with a bang.

#  Concord Casino falls to Cappelli in a close match 

 paraplegic Nick Cappelli has won the Concord Casino, beating out paraplegic opponent Jeff Hendriks in a close match.

Cappelli, who is from Buffalo, New York, was playing in his first major tournament and pulled off the upset against Hendriks, who is from Vancouver, British Columbia. The final score was 5-4 in Cappelli’s favor.

The match was watched by a large crowd of spectators and was a very competitive one. Hendriks started out strong and won the first two games. However, Cappelli rallied back to win the next three games and take the lead. Hendriks fought hard to win the next game and force a tiebreaker but ultimately lost the match.

Both players are wheelchair users and use similar equipment in order to play. This made for an interesting matchup as both players were able to adjust and compete on an equal playing field.

Cappelli is now one step closer to winning the $1 million prize that is offered to the winner of this tournament. He will be competing in the semi-finals later this week against another top player.

#  Cappelli Shows Why He is Tops at Shedding Concord Casino

The $2.7 million in cash and gambling chips seized from the home of Philadelphia mobster Salvatore Cappelli is a clear indication why this man is at the top of the casino-shedding food chain, according to law enforcement officials.

Cappelli, 58, was arrested Wednesday on racketeering, conspiracy and other charges after authorities raided his home and found the cash and chips. Investigators believe the money was headed for the Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, about 60 miles north of Philadelphia.

Authorities say Cappelli has been "a major player in casino-shedding schemes," which involve stealing large sums of money from casinos by scamming gaming machines.

Frank Farina, head of the state police organized crime unit, said Cappelli is one of the most prolific casino-shedding operators in the state. "He's at the top of the totem pole," Farina said.

Investigators believe Cappelli has stolen more than $10 million from casinos since 2004. In March, he was charged with cheating at a Valley Forge Casino Resort slot machine. Prosecutors say he won nearly $400,000 playing blackjack at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut last year.

Cappelli's arrest culminates a two-year investigation by state police and prosecutors into casino-shedding operations in eastern Pennsylvania. So far, nine people have been charged in connection with the probe.
