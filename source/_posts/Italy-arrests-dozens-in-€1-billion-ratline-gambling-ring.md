#  Italy arrests dozens in €1 billion ratline gambling ring

Italian police have arrested dozens of suspects in a €1 billion ratline gambling ring, Reuters reports.

The investigation, dubbed “New Connection,” began in June and has so far led to the arrest of 56 people accused of money laundering, fraud, and criminal association. Police believe the suspects were using the ratline to launder money from illegal gambling operations.

“The investigated network set up a system for the collection and deposit of bets on sporting events which was completely automated and ran with absolute secrecy,” said prosecutor Roberto Di Martino in a statement.

 investigators say the ringleader of the operation is a 43-year-old man from Turin who goes by the alias “King of Poker.” The man is believed to have made over €200 million from the operation.

Police also seized assets worth €9 million as part of their investigation, including real estate, luxury cars, and bank accounts.

#  Dutch police smash international ratline gambling ring

Police in the Netherlands have smashed an international gambling ring that was using the digital currency Bitcoin to launder money. The raids, which took place on Wednesday, resulted in the seizure of 150 Bitcoins, worth €1 million (£880,000/$1.2 million) at current prices.

The gambling ring was allegedly run by a Dutch national and a Russian national, who are now both in custody. They are alleged to have used a network of computers to rig online casino games and scoop winnings of tens of millions of Euros.

Bitcoin is a digital currency that is created and held electronically. It is not regulated or controlled by any bank or government, and has become increasingly popular as an investment vehicle. Its value has seen huge swings in recent months, with a single Bitcoin worth over $20,000 in December 2017 before dropping below $6,000 in February 2018.

The use of Bitcoin for illegal activities such as money laundering has been growing in recent years. In December 2017, Spanish police seized 4500 Bitcoins from a crime syndicate that had been using the currency to launder money from drug trafficking and other criminal activities.

#  French police smash multimillion-euro ratline gambling ring

A multimillion-euro illegal gambling ring allegedly run by French police officers has been smashed in a joint operation by the national police and judicial authorities.

The group is said to have operated a lucrative online betting business from a website called "PMU-ARENAPOLIS", taking bets on horse races, football matches and other sporting events.

Police say they have arrested 11 people in connection with the racket, including two police officers and a tax inspector. Investigators estimate that the ring earned some 2.5 million euros (£2.2 million) in profits over a two-year period.

The arrests were made as part of Operation Baseline, an investigation launched in December 2017 into allegations of corruption and money laundering within the French police force.

Among those detained was Christophe M., a 49-year-old policeman from the Paris suburb of Nanterre who is believed to have been behind the PMU-ARENAPOLIS website. He was charged with corruption and organised fraud.

According to prosecutors, Christophe M. set up the site in early 2017 with the help of two friends, using servers located in Belgium and Bulgaria to avoid French law enforcement authorities. The site is said to have taken illegal bets worth millions of euros from French customers.

In addition to the two policemen and one tax inspector, nine other people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the racket, including two brothers who are believed to have acted as intermediaries between Christophe M. and the punters placing bets with him.

#  Spanish police break up €1bn ratline gambling ring

Spanish police have broken up what is being called Europe’s biggest illegal gambling ring, with operations spanning 17 countries. Officers seized €1bn (£880m) in assets, including luxury cars and jewellery, and detained 67 people in raids on Tuesday.

The investigation, codenamed “Operation Carousel”, began two years ago when authorities in the southern Spanish city of Malaga noticed a surge in illegal gambling. They soon discovered the ring was controlled by a Russian-born mafia boss living in Dubai.

The crime group used online and mobile phone betting to take bets on sports events, horse races and other games of chance across Europe. Bets were placed with bookmakers based in Malta, Gibraltar, the UK and Cyprus. The gang is believed to have made profits of more than €100m a year.

Police say the ring was partly financed by organised crime groups in Russia, who use illegal gambling as a cover for money laundering. They also suspect that some of the profits from the ring were used to finance terrorism.

This latest crackdown on illegal gambling comes as the Spanish government prepares to introduce new regulations that will allow licensed casinos to offer online betting services. The new laws are intended to help protect consumers and generate tax revenue from the burgeoning online gambling market.

#  Europol: Ratline Gambling Ring has Links to Organised Crime

Europol has released a report stating that a ratline gambling ring, which has links to organised crime, has been uncovered. The ring is believed to have been operating for several years and is thought to have generated millions of euros in profits.

The ratline gambling ring was discovered following an investigation by Europol and the Italian authorities. The investigation uncovered a complex web of companies and bank accounts that were used to launder the money generated by the gambling ring.

The report also states that the ratline gambling ring has links to organised crime groups in Russia and Colombia. These groups are believed to have provided financial and logistical support to the gambling ring.

Europol’s Director, Rob Wainwright, said: “This sophisticated operation demonstrates the significant cross-border co-operation between law enforcement agencies in Europe in tackling serious organised crime. The linkages between this gambling ring and organised crime groups underscore the serious threat posed by such criminality.”

The investigation into the ratline gambling ring is ongoing and further arrests are expected.
