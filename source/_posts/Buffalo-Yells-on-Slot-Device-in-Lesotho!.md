#  Buffalo Yells on Slot Device in Lesotho!

Buffalo jerks their heads up and emit a loud, distinctive "Moo!" while grazing in the Lesotho highlands. The sound startles their herd-mates, who look around for danger before going back to grazing.

The bovine vocalization has a different purpose when coming from a slot machine in a casino. In this case, buffalo is the name of one of the many slot games offered at the tables. Players pull a lever or push a button to make the reels spin and see if they can line up three symbols of the same kind across the middle row for a payout.

Slot machines have been around for centuries in one form or another. They were originally used as vending machines to dispense candy and other small items. Gambling was added to the mix in 1887 when Charles Fey invented a three-reel machine with five symbols: horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts, and clubs. His Liberty Bell machine paid out ten nickels (50 cents) for three bells on the center line.

Slot machines proliferated in America after gambling was legalized in Nevada in 1931. They quickly became popular with people looking for an easy way to make money. By 1953 there were more than 200,000 slot machines in Nevada casinos, and by 1984 that number had grown to over half a million!

Today there are literally thousands of different slot games to choose from, each with its own quirks and features. Some have progressive jackpots that can reach into the millions of dollars, while others offer free spins or bonus rounds that can really add up over time. It's no wonder that slots are by far the most popular type of casino game!

#  Who Won the Buffalo Slot in Lesotho?

When the Lesotho government decided to auction off a license to operate the Buffalo slot, there was much anticipation. Bidders came from far and wide, all vying for a chance to manage one of Africa's most profitable gambling venues.

In the end, it was a consortium led by South African gaming company Sun International that won the bid. The company paid 2.5 billion maloti (US $325 million) for the privilege of running the casino for 20 years.

Sun International already has a presence in Lesotho, owning two casinos in Maseru. It is expected that the Buffalo slot will be a major boon to the company's bottom line.

The Buffalo slot is located in Roma, near Maseru and close to the borders of South Africa and Botswana. It offers casino games, restaurants, bars, and hotel accommodation to its visitors.

The casino has been operational since May 2017 and has been generating significant revenue for the government of Lesotho. In its first month of operation, it generated over 15 million maloti (US $2 million) in revenue. This is expected to grow as more people learn about this exciting new attraction in Lesotho.

#  Buffalo on Slot Device Goes Crazy in Lesotho!

A buffalo on slot device went crazy over the weekend at a casino in Lesotho and caused quite a scene. According to reports, the buffalo became agitated and began to damage the machine it was hooked up to. Employees were forced to call security to deal with the situation.

This is not the first time that something like this has happened at the casino. In fact, there have been several instances of animals going wild on casino property in recent months. In one incident, a baboon caused a lot of damage to a slot machine before being tranquilized by security.

Casino officials are still trying to determine what is causing these animals to behave so erratically. Some have speculated that it could be due to the machines themselves, while others believe that it's simply due to boredom or stress associated with captivity. Whatever the cause may be, it's clear that something needs to be done to prevent further incidents from occurring.

This isn't the first time that an animal has gone crazy at a casino. In 2013, a black bear caused havoc at the Black Bear Casino Resort in Minnesota. The bear tore apart several machines before being tranquilized by security guards.

#  What Does the Buffalo Slot Say in Lesotho?

In Lesotho, there is a popular saying that goes "the buffalo slot says." This phrase is often used to describe something that is said in a discreet or secretive manner. The exact origins of this expression are unclear, but it is thought to have originated from the traditional Basotho practice of leaving messages for others hidden in the furrows of sunken boulders called 'buffalo slots.'

Today, the buffalo slot saying is often used to describe secrets or things that are not meant to be widely known. For example, if someone tells you a secret and asks you not to tell anyone else, you might say "the buffalo slot says." This phrase can also be used to describe things that are said out of earshot or in private.

So why is this saying called the Buffalo Slot? The answer to this question remains a mystery, but some people believe that it may have something to do with the way that messages were left in the buffalo slots. Others believe that the name may be derived from the fact that buffaloes have large horns, which could be used to create slots in sunken boulders. Whatever the true origins of this expression may be, the Buffalo Slot saying remains an important part of Basotho culture and tradition.
