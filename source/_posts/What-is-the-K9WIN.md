#  What is the K9WIN?



The K9WIN is a new ransomware that is targeting Windows users. K9WIN was first discovered in early January, and it is believed to be the work of the same group of hackers behind the CrySiS ransomware. Like CrySiS, K9WIN uses a file extension of .k9win to identify encrypted files.


K9WIN encrypts files on the victim's computer using AES cryptography, and then demands a ransom payment in order to decrypt the files. The ransom note states that victims must pay 0.5 Bitcoin (about $225 USD) within 72 hours, or the price will increase to 1 Bitcoin. If the ransom is not paid within 72 hours, the encryption key will be destroyed and the files will be lost forever.


K9WIN leaves a ransom note called "_READ_ME_FOR_DECRYPT.txt" in every directory that has been encrypted. The ransom note contains instructions for how to pay the ransom and decrypt your files. The note also states that victims can contact the attackers by email if they have any questions or problems.


K9WIN is similar to other recent ransomware variants, such as Locky and Cerber. Like those ransomware variants, K9WIN is designed to be difficult to remove and decrypt without paying the ransom. The encryption used by K9WIN is strong and cannot be cracked without the encryption key, which is held by the attackers.


If you are infected with K9WIN, your best option is to restore your files from a backup. If you do not have a backup, then you can try to use one of the many decryption tools available online. However, there is no guarantee that these tools will work, and you may still need to pay the ransom if you want your files back.

#  What are the Oklahoma City Thunder?

The Oklahoma City Thunder are a professional basketball team based in Oklahoma City. The team is a member of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Thunder play their home games at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

The Thunder were founded in 2008 as the Seattle SuperSonics, an expansion team based in Seattle, Washington. After 41 seasons in Seattle, the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder ahead of the 2008–09 season. The Thunder won their first championship as a franchise in 2012. They also played in the NBA Finals in 2016, but lost to the Golden State Warriors.

Russell Westbrook and Paul George are currently the two biggest stars on the Thunder roster. Westbrook was named MVP of the 2017–18 season, while George was named to his fifth All-Star game. Steven Adams, Andre Roberson and Terrance Ferguson are also key members of the Thunder rotation.

#  Who was Thackeray?

Thackeray was an English author and satirist, born in 1811. He is best known for his novels, such as Vanity Fair (1847–48), and for his satirical essays such as "The Book of Snobs" (1848).

Thackeray's mother died when he was very young, leaving him to be raised largely by his father andSTEP-grandmother. This experience would have a profound influence on his later work.

In 1828, Thackeray began attending Cambridge University but left after two years without earning a degree. He then moved to London, where he started working as a journalist. It was during this time that he began writing sketches for the popular magazinePunch.

In 1839, Thackeray published his first novel, Catherine. The book was not well-received, but he followed it up with two more successful novels: The History of Henry Esmond (1852) and The Newcomes (1855).

Vanity Fair, which was published in 1847-48, is widely considered to be Thackeray's masterpiece. The satirical novel follows the lives of several characters in London society during the late 18th century.

Despite being one of the most celebrated authors of his time, Thackeray never received the same level of commercial success as some of his contemporaries, such as Charles Dickens. He died in 1863 at the age of 51.
