#  BlackjackStats Pro Shows Winnings Percentage

This information can then be used to make informed decisions about when to bet and when to hold back.

#  Winnings percentage is key to successful blackjack play

Most blackjack players know that the house edge is key to understanding the game, but what they may not realize is that the wagering percentage is just as important. In order to make money at blackjack, players must gamble with a higher percentage of their bankroll than the house does. This difference in percentages is how skilled players can overcome the house edge and come out ahead in the long run.

To calculate your necessary wagering percentage, divide 100 by the game’s theoretical house edge. So for a game with a 1% house edge, you would need to wager at least $10 for every $100 you want to win. It’s also important to remember that this percentage applies to each and every hand you play - so even if you hit a lucky streak and are up by $200, you should still be gambling with at least $10 per hand.

In most cases, sticking to basic strategy will give you the best chance of winning without having to bet too high. But if you feel comfortable deviating from basic strategy in order to increase your chances of winning, be sure to only do so when the odds are in your favor. In addition, never risk more than 2% of your bankroll on any one hand - no matter how good of a chance you think you have.

By playing smart and using a disciplined betting strategy, blackjack players can give themselves a real chance at winning money in the long run. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of coming out ahead - no matter what the casino odds may be.

A statistician by the name of William Thackeray has published a study that shows he won 92% of hands while playing blackjack in a casino.

#  How to calculate your blackjack winning percentage

The purpose of this article is to teach you how to calculate your blackjack winning percentage. This is a very important skill to have if you want to be a successful blackjack player.

There are a few different ways that you can go about calculating your winning percentage. In this article, we will teach you the most common method for doing so.

To begin, you will need to know your average number of hands per hour that you play. This number can easily be found by dividing the total number of hands you have played by the number of hours you have played. For example, if you have played 150 hands in 2 hours, then your average number of hands per hour is 75.

Once you have your average number of hands per hour, you will need to determine your win rate per hand. This number can be found by dividing your net winnings (your gross winnings minus your losses) by the total number of hands that you have played. For example, if you have netted $50 in winnings from playing 150 hands, then your win rate per hand is $0.33.

Now that you have both of these numbers, it is time to calculate your winning percentage. To do so, simply divide your win rate per hand by your average number of hands per hour. So in our example, $0.33 divided by 75 gives us a winning percentage of 0.44%.

As you can see, calculating your winning percentage is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance! By using this method, you will be able to get an accurate estimate of how well you are doing at the blackjack table. And armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about whether or not to continue playing at that particular table.
