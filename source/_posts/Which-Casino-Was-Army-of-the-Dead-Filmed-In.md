#  Who Filmed Army of the Dead in a Casino?

Army of the Dead is an upcoming zombie movie that was filmed in a casino. The zombie thriller stars Dave Bautista, known for his roles in Guardians of the Galaxy and Blade Runner 2049, and Ruby Rose, known for her roles in xXx: Return of Xander Cage and John Wick: Chapter Two.

The film is set in a world where zombies have taken over, and a small group of people are trying to survive. Army of the Dead is directed by Zack Snyder, who has also directed films such as 300, Man of Steel, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

The cast and crew have been tight-lipped about the plot of the movie, but they have released some photos and videos from the set. In one photo, Bautista can be seen armed with a shotgun while Rose hides behind him. In another photo, the two are seen sitting around a campfire with some other actors.

Snyder has said that Army of the Dead is not a remake or reboot of George Romero's 1978 classic zombie movie Dawn of the Dead. He has also said that it will be a "standalone" movie that can be watched without having seen any of his other films.

Army of the Dead is expected to be released in 2020.

#  Casino Used for Army of the Dead Filming Finally Identified

After a long and drawn out search, the casino that was used for the filming of Army of the Dead has finally been identified. The casino, which is located in Las Vegas, was used for a scene in the movie where the characters are trying to escape from a horde of zombies.

Army of the Dead was directed by Zack Snyder and released in 2008. The movie stars Josh Brolin, Ellen Page, and Ving Rhames. It is a zombie action movie that was filmed primarily in Detroit.

The casino that was used for filming has been identified as The D. However, the name of the casino was changed for the movie to avoid any legal issues. In Army of the Dead, The D is referred to as The Lucky Eagle Casino.

The D is a small casino located on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. It features just over 100 slot machines and a few table games. It is not one of the larger or more well-known casinos in Las Vegas.

Despite its small size, The D played an important role in Army of the Dead. In addition to being used for the scene where the characters are trying to escape from zombies, it also served as the location for some of the movie's promotional material.

The casino has become something of a tourist attraction since Army of the Dead was released. Visitors can still visit The D and see where some of the iconic scenes from the movie were filmed.
