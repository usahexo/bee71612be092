#  Bucs End Winless Streak with Big Victory Over the Google

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers finally ended their winless streak last Sunday, with an impressive victory over the Google at home. The Bucs defense was relentless, sacking Google quarterback Sam Bradford six times and intercepting him twice.

Quarterback Jameis Winston had a big day for the Bucs, completing 23 of 32 passes for 280 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for a touchdown late in the game to seal the victory.

“Finally!” said Winston after the game. “We’ve been working hard all year and it feels great to get a win. This is a big boost for our team morale going into the playoffs.”

The Bucs will now travel to Seattle to take on the Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs.

#  Vegas Reacts to Buccaneers Dominating Victory Over Google

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers gave Google a 48-point beatdown on Sunday, and Vegas couldn’t have been happier.

In fact, the sportsbooks had to scramble to make some moves in order to account for the massive upset.

According to ESPN’s David Purdum, the William Hill sportsbook took a $100,000 bet on the Buccaneers at +500 odds ($500 bet would win $2500).

That move moved the line all the way up to Tampa Bay -3.5 points, and as you can imagine, there were plenty of people who took advantage of that juicy line.

However, even with all of that action on the Buccaneers, there were still plenty of people who backed Google - including one bettor who placed a $5000 wager on the search engine giant.

In the end, though, it was all for naught as Tampa Bay ran away with a 48-0 victory.

#  Bucs Finally Get One in the Win Column With Impressive Victory Over the Google

After starting the season with a dismal 0-3 record, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were finally able to get in the win column with a convincing 41-14 victory over the Google.

Quarterback Jameis Winston had an impressive game, completing 27 of his 38 passes for 376 yards and four touchdowns. He also rushed for another touchdown.

"It feels good to finally get a win," said Winston. "We're going to keep working hard and try to build on this."

The Buccaneers' defense was also impressive, holding the Google to just 14 points. Defensive end Noah Spence led the way with three sacks.

"We played lights out today," said Spence. "This is definitely a big win for us."

With the victory, the Buccaneers move to 1-3 on the season. They will look to build on this momentum when they take on the Cincinnati Bengals next week.

#  Buccaneers Rout Google For First Win of Season

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers routed Google for their first win of the season. The 41-14 victory improves their record to 1-3, as they head into their bye week.

Quarterback Jameis Winston played his best game of the season, completing 25 of 38 passes for 334 yards and four touchdowns. Wide receiver Mike Evans had himself a day, with seven receptions for 147 yards and three touchdowns.

The Bucs got off to a fast start, scoring on their opening drive. Winston completed all five of his passes on the drive for 73 yards, including a six-yard touchdown pass to Evans. The teams would trade touchdowns throughout the first half, with Tampa Bay leading 28-14 at halftime.

The Bucs would pull away in the second half, scoring two more touchdowns while holding Google scoreless. Winston completed all six of his passes in the third quarter for 107 yards and two touchdowns. One of those touchdowns went to DeSean Jackson, who had three catches for 104 yards on the day.

It was an impressive victory for Tampa Bay, who looked like a different team than the one that started the season 0-3. They will look to build on this win when they return from their bye week in Week 5 against the New England Patriots.

#  Buccaneers Topple Google In Shutout Victory

In a stunning upset victory, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers have toppled Google in a shutout victory.

The Buccaneers' defense was relentless, not allowing a single point to be scored by Google. The offense was powered by QB Jameis Winston and a strong running game, led by Doug Martin and Charles Sims.

"We were fired up coming into this game," said Winston. "Google is a great organization, but we knew we could win if we played our best."

This victory is sure to give the Buccaneers some confidence as they head into the playoffs. They will face either the Seattle Seahawks or the Minnesota Vikings in the first round.
