Are you looking for the best and safest online casino sites of 2019? You've come to the right place! In this article, we'll recommend our top five picks for the best and safest online casinos.

Before we get started, let's first explain what we mean by "safe." When we say a casino is safe, we mean that it's reputable and trustworthy. It's important to choose an online casino that is reputable and has a good reputation, as there are many casinos out there that are not safe.

So, how do you know if an online casino is safe? There are several things you can look for, including licensing and regulation, customer support, security features, and payout percentage.

Licensing and regulation is one of the most important factors to look for when choosing a safe online casino. The best online casinos are licensed by well-known and respected jurisdictions, such as the UK Gambling Commission or Malta Gaming Authority. Reputable licensing authorities will ensure that the casino complies with all of the relevant regulations and provides a fair gaming experience.

Customer support is another important factor to consider when choosing a safe online casino. The best casinos offer 24/7 customer support via telephone, email, or live chat. If you ever have a problem or question while playing at an online casino, you want to be able to get help quickly and easily.

Security features are also important when choosing a safe online casino. The best casinos use state-of-the-art security technologies to protect your personal information and financial data. They also use secure encryption technology to protect your gameplay data.

Payout percentage is another important factor to consider when choosing a safe online casino. The payout percentage is the amount of money returned to players in terms of winnings. The higher the payout percentage, the better the odds are at the casino. Reputable casinos have payout percentages of 95% or higher.
