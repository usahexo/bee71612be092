#  Houston Astros looking to repeat as division champions in 2017

The Houston Astros ended the 2016 season with a disappointing loss in the ALDS to the Kansas City Royals. However, the Astros are looking to build off of their success in 2017 and repeat as division champions.

The Astros are led by reigning AL MVP, Jose Altuve, who is coming off of a season where he hit .346 with 24 home runs and knocked in 96 RBI. The Astros also have shortstop Carlos Correa, who is coming off of an All-Star season in which he hit .274 with 20 home runs and 84 RBI.

The Astros will also be adding some new pieces to their lineup this season, including third baseman Alex Bregman and outfielder Derek Fisher. Bregman hit .294 with 8 home runs and 42 RBI in 53 games last season with the Astros, while Fisher hit .303 with 17 home runs and 45 RBI in 97 games at Triple-A.

The Astros' pitching staff is also one of the strongest in the league. They are led by Cy Young Award winner Dallas Keuchel, who had a 14-5 record with a 2.90 ERA last season. They also have Lance McCullers Jr., who had a 3.22 ERA last season, and Charlie Morton, who had a 3.62 ERA.

With a strong lineup and pitching staff, the Astros are looking like the team to beat in the AL West division this season.

#  Los Angeles Angels continue to add talent in hopes of contending

The Los Angeles Angels have been one of the most active teams this offseason, revamping their roster in an attempt to contend in the American League.

First, they traded for Ian Kinsler from the Tigers, bolstering their infield defense and adding another veteran presence. Then they signed Zack Cozart to a three-year deal, giving them a shortstop who can provide some power.

They also added Justin Upton to their outfield, giving them a potent trio of hitters alongside Mike Trout and Albert Pujols. With these moves, the Angels are now considered one of the favorites to win the AL West.

Many people were skeptical of the Angels' ability to compete after they failed to make the playoffs last season. But with all of these new additions, they now have a much stronger lineup and should be able to contend for a playoff spot.

Cozart is coming off a career year in which he hit .297 with 24 homers and 63 RBIs. He'll be a huge upgrade over Andrelton Simmons at shortstop and should provide some much-needed power for the Angels.

Upton is also coming off a good year in which he hit .273 with 26 homers and 94 RBIs for the Tigers and Braves. He gives the Angels another powerful bat in their lineup and should be a big help in driving in runs.

Kinsler is also coming off a strong season in which he hit .236 with 22 homers and 83 RBIs. He'll be an important part of the Angels' lineup, providing veteran leadership and stability on offense.

With all these new additions, the Angels are poised for a breakout season in 2018. They may not be able to match up with the Astros or Red Sox in terms of talent, but they should be able to compete with anyone else in the AL West.

#  Seattle Mariners looking to build off last year's success

The Seattle Mariners had a successful 2017 season, finishing with an 87-75 record and earning a trip to the playoffs. They were ultimately defeated by the Houston Astros in the ALDS, but they showed that they are a team to be reckoned with going forward.

One of the main reasons for Seattle's success last year was their strong bullpen. The 'pen posted a 3.38 ERA, good for fourth in the majors, and key contributors like Edwin Diaz and David Phelps will be back this year.

The starting rotation also looks promising, with James Paxton and Felix Hernandez leading the way. Both pitchers had solid seasons in 2017, and if they can repeat those performances in 2018, the Mariners will be in good shape.

Offensively, Seattle will be counting on Nelson Cruz and Robinson Cano to continue driving in runs.Cruz had another excellent year last season, while Cano is coming off a down year but is still one of the most productive hitters in baseball.

With a strong core of players returning from last year's squad and some additions via free agency (e.g. Dee Gordon), the Mariners look poised to make a deep run into the playoffs this season.

#  Oakland Athletics rebuilding once again

The Oakland Athletics are in the process of rebuilding for the third time in the past four years.

In 2015, they went all-in on a rebuild, trading away stars like Josh Donaldson and Yoenis Cespedes in an attempt to stockpile young talent. The plan didn't work, as the team finished with the worst record in baseball.

In 2017, they tried to build around their young talent, but that didn't go much better, as the team finished with the third-worst record in baseball.

Now, they're rebuilding again. This time, they're trying a different approach, building around younger players instead of veterans.

The most important player on their young roster is shortstop Marcus Semien. Semien is coming off a breakout season in which he hit 27 home runs and drove in 85 runs. He's also a Gold Glove-caliber defender who can play all over the infield.

Right-hander Sean Manaea is another key player on their young roster. Manaea had an up-and-down rookie season last year, but he's still one of the most promising pitchers in baseball.

Outfielder Matt Olson is also worth watching. Olson hit 23 home runs as a rookie last year, and he has the potential to be one of the most dangerous hitters in baseball.

The Athletics are still a few years away from contending, but there's plenty of young talent on their roster worth keeping an eye on.

#  Texas Rangers still the favorite in a wide open division

The Texas Rangers are still the clear favorites to win the AL West this season. Despite a subpar showing in 2016, the Rangers have one of the most talented rosters in baseball, with MVP candidates in outfielder Ian Desmond and first baseman Mike Napoli. They also have a strong starting rotation led by Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish.

The Houston Astros made some big additions this offseason, but they are still not quite at the level of the Rangers. The Seattle Mariners made some major upgrades as well, but they are still a few years away from competing for the division title. This leaves the Los Angeles Angels and Oakland Athletics as the two biggest challengers to the Rangers in 2017.

The Angels made a few big signings this offseason, including outfielder Justin Upton and second baseman Brandon Phillips. They also have a strong starting rotation led by Garrett Richards and Jered Weaver. However, their bullpen is still a question mark and they lack depth at shortstop and catcher.

The Athletics had a busy offseason, signing several key players including designated hitter Khris Davis and starting pitchers Kendall Graveman and Sean Manaea. However, they are still relying on aging veterans like Rajai Davis and Trevor Cahill to lead their offense and rotation. It remains to be seen if this young team can compete with the established teams in the AL West.
