#  CS GO Gambling: Sites That Are Legit And Pay!



Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) is a first person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. Released in August 2012, it is the fourth game in the main Counter-Strike series. Like other games in the series, Global Offensive pits teams of counter-terrorists against terrorists in a series of rounds, with the goal of completing an objective or eliminating the other team. Unlike traditional competitive first-person shooters where players compete for a kill or to control a specific area on the map, CS:GO places more emphasis on teamwork and tactics.

One way that players can obtain cosmetic items and weapons skins in CS:GO is through opening cases that are rewarded at the end of each match. These cases may contain one or more weapon skins, and sometimes exclusive weapon skins that are not available anywhere else. Skins can also be obtained by trading with other users, or by purchasing them from Steam, OPSkins, BitSkins, or other third party markets. 

Since skins are considered as virtual items within CS:GO, they are subject to the same trading restrictions as any other virtual item in the game. This means that skins cannot be directly transferred from one user to another, but must instead be traded through a third party market site. 

Third party market sites have been around since early 2017, and allow users to buy and sell weapon skins for real world currency. The most popular site for this is OPSkins, which has over 5 million registered users as of October 2017. Other sites like BitSkins and SkinXchange also have a large user base. 

While there are many legitimate third party market sites out there, there are also many scam sites that attempt to steal user's money. In order to help users avoid these scam sites, we have compiled a list of verified and trustworthy third party market sites below. 

Verified Sites: 
- OPSkins 
- BitSkins
