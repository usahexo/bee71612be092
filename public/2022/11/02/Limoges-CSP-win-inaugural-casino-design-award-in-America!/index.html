      		<h1 id="Limoges-CSP-win-inaugural-casino-design-award-in-America"><a href="#Limoges-CSP-win-inaugural-casino-design-award-in-America" class="headerlink" title="Limoges CSP win inaugural casino design award in America!"></a>Limoges CSP win inaugural casino design award in America!</h1><p>The city of Limoges in south-western France is celebrating this week after its basketball club, Limoges CSP, won the inaugural casino design award in America. The team was up against stiff competition from clubs in Las Vegas and Atlantic City but managed to clinch the top prize with their innovative and eye-catching design for a new casino resort.</p>
<p>The new casino will be built on the edge of the city overlooking the stunning vistas of the Limousin countryside and is set to become a major tourist attraction. It will feature all the latest gaming technology as well as a luxury hotel, restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>Mayor Michel Boutant was over the moon with the win, praising the team’s hard work and creativity. He said that it was a great honour for Limoges CSP to receive this award and that it would help put the city on the map of world-class destinations.</p>
<p>The team’s architect, Philippe Forissier, was also delighted with the win. He praised the hard work and dedication of his team, who had put in many hours of research and design work to come up with a winning concept. He said that he was proud to have been able to bring such an ambitious project to life and that he looked forward to seeing it come to fruition.</p>
<p>Construction on the new casino is due to start later this year and it is expected to be completed by 2020.</p>
<h1 id="First-American-casino-designed-by-French-company-Limoges-CSP"><a href="#First-American-casino-designed-by-French-company-Limoges-CSP" class="headerlink" title="First American casino designed by French company Limoges CSP!"></a>First American casino designed by French company Limoges CSP!</h1><p>Casino du Liban, the first and only American casino designed by French company Limoges CSP, inaugurated today in the presence of high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>The casino, which is spread over an area of ​​10,000 square meters, offers a unique experience to visitors with its luxurious design and its wide range of games.</p>
<p>It has around 130 gaming tables and more than 1,500 slot machines.</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony was attended by MP Ghassan Moukheiber, Minister Talal Arslan and several ambassadors.</p>
<p>Minister Arslan said: “We are confident that Casino du Liban will contribute to the development of tourism in Lebanon.” MP Ghassan Moukheiber added: “We are very pleased that this casino has been inaugurated in Lebanon given the great potential it has to attract tourists.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-magnate-praises-innovative-Limoges-CSP-design"><a href="#Casino-magnate-praises-innovative-Limoges-CSP-design" class="headerlink" title="Casino magnate praises innovative Limoges CSP design!"></a>Casino magnate praises innovative Limoges CSP design!</h1><p>Casino magnate and owner of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, Sheldon Adelson, has praised the newly-opened Limoges CSP casino in France for its innovative design. The lavish new casino, which opened earlier this year, features a unique ‘circular’ design that has been praised by industry experts and players alike.</p>
<p>Adelson was in attendance at the opening of the casino, and he was quoted as saying: “This is an amazing casino - the design is incredible. I’m really excited to see how it does in the market.”</p>
<p>The Limoges CSP casino is located in the city of Limoges in central France, and it is the first casino to open in the country since a nationwide ban on gambling was lifted in 2010. The casino has been designed to appeal to both high-rollers and casual gamblers, with a range of games on offer including blackjack, roulette and poker.</p>
<p>The ‘circular’ design of the casino has proved to be a major hit with players and critics alike, with many praising its simple yet elegant layout. The casino is spread over three floors, with each floor featuring a different type of game. There is also a VIP lounge for high-rollers, as well as bars and restaurants for guests to enjoy.</p>
<p>One industry expert said of the new casino: “This could be a major game changer for the gambling industry in France. The circular design makes it really easy to navigate, and there’s something for everyone here.”</p>
<p>The opening of the Limoges CSP casino comes at a time when gambling is re-establishing itself as a major form of entertainment in France. In recent years, several new casinos have opened up across the country, including one owned by Adelson himself. The Limoges CSP casino is expected to be one of the most successful ones yet, thanks to its innovative design and wealth of games on offer.</p>
<h1 id="French-flair-hits-the-heart-of-the-casino-scene-in-America"><a href="#French-flair-hits-the-heart-of-the-casino-scene-in-America" class="headerlink" title="French flair hits the heart of the casino scene in America!"></a>French flair hits the heart of the casino scene in America!</h1><p>Casinos have taken America by storm, offering thrills and excitement that can be found nowhere else. But now it seems as if something new and unique is happening in the casino scene – a touch of French flair!</p>
<p>Just take a look at the recently opened Resorts World Casino in New York. This glittering new casino doesn’t just offer all of the normal games and attractions that one would expect, but it also features a spectacular French-themed restaurant called L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon. This restaurant is widely considered to be one of the best in the world, and its presence in a major American casino is an indication of just how important French culture has become in the US gambling scene.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems as if French influence can be found throughout the casino industry these days. Just take a look at the Wynn Las Vegas resort, which was designed by star French architect Phillipe Starck. This resort is full of luxurious Parisian touches, from its delicate crystal chandeliers to its artfully tiled floors. It’s no wonder that Wynn Las Vegas has been voted “the most elegant casino in America” on several occasions!</p>
<p>So what is behind this sudden surge of French influence in American casinos? One possible explanation is that Americans are simply becoming more interested in French culture overall. France has long been regarded as one of the most cultured and sophisticated countries in the world, and its cuisine, art, and architecture are now considered to be some of the best in the world. It’s no wonder that Americans are starting to emulate some of France’s most iconic elements in their own casinos!</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it’s clear that American casinos are getting more and more French-inspired every day. If you want to experience a touch of Parisian luxury while you gamble, there’s no better place to go than a modern American casino!</p>
<h1 id="Limited-Edition-The-first-American-Casino-designed-by-Limoges-CSP"><a href="#Limited-Edition-The-first-American-Casino-designed-by-Limoges-CSP" class="headerlink" title="Limited Edition: The first American Casino designed by Limoges CSP"></a>Limited Edition: The first American Casino designed by Limoges CSP</h1><p>In the heart of Reno, Nevada, the first American casino has been designed by Limoges CSP. The $360 million development is a major milestone for the French company, which until now had only developed resorts in other countries.</p>
<p>The 400,000-square-foot complex will feature 3,000 slot machines and 120 gaming tables, as well as restaurants, bars and a spa. “This is a very proud day for us,” said Pascal Bataille, CEO of Limoges CSP.</p>
<p>The casino will be open from 10am to 4am daily, and employ 2,000 people. It’s expected to attract around 8 million visitors a year. “We are absolutely confident that this project will be a great success,” said Bataille.</p>
