<p>So far, two seasons of “Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji” have been aired, with a third season currently in production.</p>
<h1 id="Do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-be-a-gambler-Find-out-in-this-new-anime"><a href="#Do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-be-a-gambler-Find-out-in-this-new-anime" class="headerlink" title="Do you have what it takes to be a gambler?

For others, it can be a way to make a living. No matter which camp you fall into, there’s no doubt that gambling can be thrilling. If you’re looking for an anime that captures all the excitement of gambling, look no further than Kakegurui.</p>
<p>Kakegurui is set at a prestigious school called Hyakkaou Private Academy. At this school, students are divided into two groups: the gamblers and the victims. The gamblers are the ones who enjoy gambling and love to take risks. The victims are the ones who lose everything they have to the gamblers.</p>
<p>The story follows Yumeko Jabami, a new student at Hyakkaou Private Academy. Yumeko is a total outsider and has no idea how to play any of the games that are popular at the school. However, she’s not afraid to take risks and quickly becomes one of the most feared students at Hyakkaou Private Academy.</p>

<h1 id="Gambling-anime-is-sure-to-get-your-heart-racing"><a href="#Gambling-anime-is-sure-to-get-your-heart-racing" class="headerlink" title="Gambling anime is sure to get your heart racing!"></a>Gambling anime is sure to get your heart racing!</h1><p>Anime has been around for decades, and over that time it has consistently produced new and exciting genres. One such genre is gambling anime, which can be thought of as the thriller equivalent of animation. These shows are packed with excitement, suspense, and a healthy dose of adrenaline-pumping action. If you’re looking for a show that will keep you entertained from beginning to end, then a gambling anime is certainly worth considering!</p>
<p>One of the earliest examples of gambling anime is 1994’s “Shin Ace o Nerae!” or “Aim for the Ace!” The story follows Reiko Akagi, a high school girl who becomes obsessed with tennis and sets her sights on becoming the best player in Japan. What starts out as a simple sports story soon develops into a gripping tale of competition, betrayal, and obsession. With nail-biting matches and plenty of twists and turns, “Shin Ace o Nerae!” is sure to get your heart racing!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something more recent, then 2007’s “Kaiji” is well worth watching. The show tells the story of Kaiji Itou, a down-on-his-luck man who is coerced into participating in an illegal gambling ring. Kaiji quickly learns that he’s up against some of the most ruthless gamblers in the business, and must use all his cunning and intelligence if he wants to survive. Filled with intense action and suspense, “Kaiji” is one roller coaster ride you won’t want to miss!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an anime with a female protagonist, then 2015’s “Hundred” is definitely worth watching. The show tells the story of Hayato Kisaragi, a teenage boy who enrolls in a prestigious academy that trains students to fight alien invaders. Hayato soon discovers that the academy is actually a training ground for fighters known as “Hundred,” capable of wielding enormous power. With battles against powerful aliens awaiting him at every turn, Hayato must master the art of summoning his Hundred if he wants to save the world from destruction!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something more lighthearted than the previous entries on this list, then 2012’s “Tiger &amp; Bunny” may be just what you’re looking for. The show takes place in a future world where superheroes are commonplace. One such hero is Tiger (real name: Kotetsu T Kaburagi), who operates as part of a team known as Hero TV. However, when one member of their team abruptly retires, Tiger finds himself paired up with rookie Barnaby Brooks Jr., much to his dismay! As they fight crime together however, Tiger &amp; Bunny come to learn more about each other both professionally and personally. A funny and heartfelt show that’s perfect for those looking for something lighthearted and enjoyable!</p>
