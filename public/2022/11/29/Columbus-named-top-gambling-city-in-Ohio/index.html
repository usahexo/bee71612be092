                <h1>Columbus named top gambling city in Ohio</h1>

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Columbus-named-top-gambling-city-in-Ohio"><a href="#Columbus-named-top-gambling-city-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="Columbus named top gambling city in Ohio"></a>Columbus named top gambling city in Ohio</h1><p>COLUMBUS, OH - The city of Columbus was recently named the number one gambling city in Ohio by Casino.org. The website ranked the cities based on the number of casino establishments per capita.</p>
<p>According to Casino.org, Columbus has six casino establishments, which is more than any other city in the state. Cleveland and Cincinnati each have four casinos, while Akron has just one.</p>
<p>“Columbus seems to have it all when it comes to gambling,” said Casino.org spokesperson Jackie Diamond. “The city has a wide variety of casinos, including racinos, poker rooms, and traditional casinos.”</p>
<p>Diamond also cited Columbus’ affordable prices as a reason for its ranking. The average price for a room at a casino in Columbus is just $67, while the average price in Cleveland is $86 and the average price in Cincinnati is $92.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the news of Columbus’ top ranking has been well-received by local casinos and businesses.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be recognized as the top gambling destination in Ohio,” said Rex Jackson, general manager of Hollywood Casino Columbus. “Our team works hard to provide our guests with a first-class gaming experience and we are looking forward to continued success.”</p>
<h1 id="Cincinnati-second-in-Ohio-for-gambling-winnings"><a href="#Cincinnati-second-in-Ohio-for-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Cincinnati second in Ohio for gambling winnings"></a>Cincinnati second in Ohio for gambling winnings</h1><p>This may come as a surprise to some, but according to recent data from the Ohio Casino Control Commission, Cincinnati ranks second in the state for gambling winnings. In total, Cincinnatians took in more than $103 million from casinos in 2017.</p>
<p>The news is not all good, however. That figure represents a nearly $5 million increase over 2016 earnings, and it’s indicative of a larger trend across the country. Gambling addiction rates are on the rise, and they’re taking an increasing toll on both individuals and families.</p>
<p>Experts say there are a number of reasons for this uptick. For one thing, casinos are becoming increasingly available as states legalize them. And with online gaming also on the rise, it’s easier than ever for people to get hooked on gambling.</p>
<p>Addiction can have a devastating impact on individuals and their families. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and even suicide. If you or someone you love is struggling with a gambling addiction, don’t wait until it’s too late. Seek help now.</p>
<p>There are many resources available to those who need it. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has a website that offers information on gambling addiction and how to get help. You can also call their hotline at 1-800-522-4700 for 24/7 assistance.</p>
<h1 id="Steubenville-listed-as-having-biggest-casino-payouts-in-the-Buckeye-State"><a href="#Steubenville-listed-as-having-biggest-casino-payouts-in-the-Buckeye-State" class="headerlink" title="Steubenville listed as having biggest casino payouts in the Buckeye State"></a>Steubenville listed as having biggest casino payouts in the Buckeye State</h1><p>Looking for a place to gamble and potentially walk away with some serious cash? Look no further than Steubenville, Ohio.</p>
<p>According to recent data from the Ohio Casino Control Commission, the city of Steubenville has the biggest casino payouts in the Buckeye State. In fact, players in Steubenville have won over $93 million dollars in casino payouts since the state’s casinos first opened their doors.</p>
<p>What makes Steubenville so attractive to casino-goers? It may have something to do with the city’s casino mix. The Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course offers both slots and table games, while the Belterra Park Gaming &amp; Entertainment Center specializes in slots only. This variety may be one of the reasons why players have walked away with so much money in recent years.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a place to try your hand at some slots or table games, Steubenville is definitely worth a visit. With over $93 million in payouts already paid out, there’s certainly some potential for big wins waiting to be had.</p>
<h1 id="Akron-citizens-taking-home-the-most-money-from-slots-and-tables-statewide"><a href="#Akron-citizens-taking-home-the-most-money-from-slots-and-tables-statewide" class="headerlink" title="Akron citizens taking home the most money from slots and tables statewide"></a>Akron citizens taking home the most money from slots and tables statewide</h1><p>While casinos dot the landscape of Ohio, each with their own offerings to visitors, Akron residents Coming out on top in terms of total amount of money taken home from slots and table games.</p>
<p>According to data released by the Ohio Casino Control Commission, in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, Akronites took home more than $6.4 million from casino gambling – nearly twice as much as the runner-up city, Columbus. </p>
<p>Akron’s lead is even more pronounced when it comes to slot machines. The City of Goodyear pulled in over $4 million from slots – more than any other city in the state. Cincinnati was a distant second with just over $2 million. </p>
<p>Table games also favored Akronites; collectively they raked in over $2.4 million – again significantly more than any other municipality. Second-place Columbus only managed about $1.5 million. </p>
<p>Industry analysts say there are a variety of reasons for Akron’s success at the casino tables and slots. </p>
<p>For one thing, as smaller cities they may not be as well-served by existing casinos as large metropolitan areas like Columbus or Cincinnati. In addition, local residents may be more inclined to gamble when there’s little else to do in their town. Finally, given that there are four casinos in Ohio within reasonable driving distance of Akron, residents may simply be more familiar with them or feel less constrained by proximity than gamblers in other parts of the state. </p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, one thing is clear: Akronites love their casino gambling, and they’re taking home more money from it than anyone else in Ohio.</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-sees-largest-gambling-profits-of-any-city-in-the-state"><a href="#Cleveland-sees-largest-gambling-profits-of-any-city-in-the-state" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland sees largest gambling profits of any city in the state"></a>Cleveland sees largest gambling profits of any city in the state</h1><p>In fiscal year 2017, Cleveland was the city with the highest gambling profits of any city in the state of Ohio. This is according to data released by the Ohio Casino Control Commission this week. Cleveland saw nearly $236 million in gambling profits last year, more than Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo combined.</p>
<p>The $236 million figure for Cleveland is down from the $251 million the city took in during fiscal year 2016. However, it’s still significantly more than what any other city in the state generated. Columbus came in second with gambling profits of just over $129 million last year, while Cincinnati brought in a little over $81 million and Toledo brought in about $62 million.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite having fewer casinos than some of its neighbors, Cleveland still managed to generate more gambling profits than Columbus, Cincinnati, and Toledo combined. That’s likely due to the fact that Cleveland’s casinos are much larger than those found in other cities. For example, Cleveland’s Hard Rock Rocksino is one of the largest casinos in the country.</p>
<p>The Ohio Casino Control Commission’s report also provides a detailed breakdown of how each casino performed last year. The two biggest earners were again the Hard Rock Rocksino and JACK Cleveland Casino, which brought in $101 million and $86 million respectively. The JACK Thistledown Racino was a distant third with profits of just over $27 million.</p>
<p>Cleveland’s other casinos all generated less than $20 million each last year. However, it’s worth noting that these casinos are much smaller and only offer slots and video poker machines, whereas the Hard Rock Rocksino and JACK Cleveland Casino both offer table games as well.</p>
<p>The good news for Cleveland is that its gambling profits continue to be on the rise even as other cities see their numbers decline. In fact, since fiscal year 2012, Cleveland’s gambling profits have increased by nearly 70%.</p>
