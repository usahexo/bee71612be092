This law would prohibit any type of wagering on games that involve player skills, such as fantasy sports or poker.</p>
<p>Delaware legalized gambling in 1976 and has been one of the leading states in the country when it comes to gambling revenue. However, lawmakers have been growing increasingly concerned about the growth of skill-based gambling, which they believe is threatening traditional forms of casino gambling.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Power Strike Super Spin legislation argue that it is necessary to protect casinos from competition. They also maintain that allowing skill-based gambling could result in increased addiction rates and social problems.</p>
<p> opponents of the bill argue that it is unnecessary and will only serve to drive these games underground. They also claim that there is no evidence that skill-based gambling is harmful, and that it should be allowed so that people can make their own choices about whether or not to participate.</p>
<p>The fate of the Power Strike Super Spin legislation remains uncertain, but it is clear that the debate over skill-based gambling will continue to rage on.</p>
<h1 id="Skill-Based-Gaming-Continues-to-Cause-Legal-Issues-as-Delaware-Seeks-to-Ban-Power-Strike-Super-Spin"><a href="#Skill-Based-Gaming-Continues-to-Cause-Legal-Issues-as-Delaware-Seeks-to-Ban-Power-Strike-Super-Spin" class="headerlink" title="Skill-Based Gaming Continues to Cause Legal Issues as Delaware Seeks to Ban Power Strike Super Spin"></a>Skill-Based Gaming Continues to Cause Legal Issues as Delaware Seeks to Ban Power Strike Super Spin</h1><p>Skill-based gaming continues to be a point of contention across the country and, most recently, in Delaware where the state is looking to ban Power Strike Super Spin. </p>
<p>Senate Bill 165 would prohibit any game that uses physical skills to control game play, which is defined as “any game where the skill of the player controls game play to a greater degree than chance.” This follows on the heels of other states looking into or banning such games, with Ohio passing a similar bill in November of last year. </p>
<p>The arguments for and against these types of games are well-worn at this point. Supporters argue that skill-based games are more fair because they rely more on player skill than chance, while opponents claim that they are nothing more than gambling machines dressed up as games. </p>
<p>Delaware’s law would not apply to games like pinball or skee ball that use physical skills, but instead would target games like casino classic blackjack or poker that use cards and dice. It’s not clear what prompted Delaware to take action now, especially since it does not have any casinos within its borders, but it is likely a response to pressure from neighbouring states with gambling industries. </p>
<p>Whether this type of legislation will spread throughout the United States remains to be seen, but it is clear that the issue of skill-based gaming is far from settled.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Bristle-as-Delaware-Announces-Plans-to-Ban-Skill-Based-Gambling-with-Power-Strike-Super-Spin"><a href="#Gamblers-Bristle-as-Delaware-Announces-Plans-to-Ban-Skill-Based-Gambling-with-Power-Strike-Super-Spin" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Bristle as Delaware Announces Plans to Ban Skill-Based Gambling with Power Strike Super Spin"></a>Gamblers Bristle as Delaware Announces Plans to Ban Skill-Based Gambling with Power Strike Super Spin</h1><p>Gamblers across Delaware are in an uproar after the state government announced its plans to ban skill-based gambling with Power Strike Super Spin.</p>
<p>The new ban, set to take effect later this year, outlaws all games that involve any level of skill on the part of the player, including popular favorites like poker, blackjack and craps.</p>
<p>Delaware’s decision to crack down on skill-based gambling comes as other states around the country are legalizing and regulating the games. In fact, Nevada has already become a hotspot for skill-based gambling, with Las Vegas casinos offering a wide variety of games including poker, blackjack and slots.</p>
<p>Governor John Carney defended the decision to ban skill-based gambling in Delaware, insisting that it was important to protect casino workers and their jobs.</p>
<p>“Casino workers in our state have families to support and we need to do everything we can to protect their jobs,” Governor Carney said in a statement. “Skill-based gambling is a growing industry and we simply cannot allow it to take hold in Delaware.”</p>
<p>Critics of the ban say that it will only drive gamblers underground, where they will be forced to play unregulated and potentially dangerous games. They also argue that the ban will cost Delaware millions of dollars in lost tax revenue.</p>
<p>“This is a terrible decision by the state government,” said casino lobbyist James Sirota. “It will have a devastating impact on our state’s economy and cost thousands of people their jobs.”</p>
<h1 id="State-of-Delaware-Takes-on-Skill-based-Gaming-with-New-Power-Strike-Super-Spin-Legislation"><a href="#State-of-Delaware-Takes-on-Skill-based-Gaming-with-New-Power-Strike-Super-Spin-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="State of Delaware Takes on Skill-based Gaming with New Power Strike Super Spin Legislation"></a>State of Delaware Takes on Skill-based Gaming with New Power Strike Super Spin Legislation</h1><p>Delaware is one of the latest states to jump on the skill-based gaming bandwagon, with new legislation allowing for Power Strike Super Spin machines.</p>
<p>The legislation, which was signed into law by Governor John Carney on October 2, 2018, authorizes up to 10 locations in the state to offer the games. The Delaware Lottery Commission will oversee the rollout and has already begun accepting applications from potential operators.</p>
<p> skill-based gaming machines are seen as a way to attract younger players and help compete with casinos that have been popping up in surrounding states.</p>
<p>The games work by allowing players to use their skills to control a spin of a virtual wheel in order to win prizes. Unlike traditional slot machines, which rely purely on chance, these games give players a chance to improve their odds by using their skills.</p>
<p>This new type of game has been growing in popularity across the country and can be found at casinos in states such as New Jersey, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. Delaware becomes the 8th state to allow for skill-based gaming machines.</p>
<p>Governor Carney said in a statement that he was “pleased” to sign the bill into law, noting that it would provide “a new entertainment option for Delawareans and create jobs in our state’s casino industry.”</p>
<p>Some opponents of the legislation had raised concerns about potential negative effects on existing casino businesses, but Carney noted that the new games would be “an addition to our existing gaming offerings, not a replacement.”</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Senate-Bill-Seeks-to-Ban-Skill-Based-Gambling-in-the-Form-of-Power-Strike-Super-Spin"><a href="#Delaware-Senate-Bill-Seeks-to-Ban-Skill-Based-Gambling-in-the-Form-of-Power-Strike-Super-Spin" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Senate Bill Seeks to Ban Skill-Based Gambling in the Form of Power Strike Super Spin"></a>Delaware Senate Bill Seeks to Ban Skill-Based Gambling in the Form of Power Strike Super Spin</h1><p>The Delaware State Senate is considering a bill that would ban the operation of skill-based gambling machines, specifically mentioning Power Strike Super Spin as an example.</p>
<p>Introduced by state senator Harris McDowell on February 8th, 2018, the bill seeks to prohibit any business from operating a machine that allows a person to gamble on their skill at playing the game.</p>
<p>The proposed bill specifically highlights Power Strike Super Spin – a game that has become popular in convenience stores and other small businesses across Delaware in recent years. The game consists of a vertical row of six spinning balls, each with a different number value. Players must use a joystick to stop the balls as they spin, and then match the numbers to win prizes.</p>
<p>Police and other officials have expressed concern over the growing popularity of Power Strike Super Spin and similar games, as they believe they can be addictive and lead to gambling addiction problems. Senator McDowell echoed these concerns in his statement introducing the bill, saying “The proliferation of these games represents nothing more than thinly veiled gambling devices that prey on our citizens and present unacceptable risks.”</p>
<p>There is currently no vote scheduled on the bill, but it will likely be debated in committee hearings in the coming weeks.</p>
