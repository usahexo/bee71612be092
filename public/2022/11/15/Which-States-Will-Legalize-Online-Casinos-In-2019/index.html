      		<h1 id="Which-States-Will-Legalize-Online-Casinos-In-2019"><a href="#Which-States-Will-Legalize-Online-Casinos-In-2019" class="headerlink" title="Which States Will Legalize Online Casinos In 2019?"></a>Which States Will Legalize Online Casinos In 2019?</h1><p>It’s been a difficult few years for the US gambling industry, as most states have refused to legalize any form of online casinos. However, this looks set to change in 2019, with a number of states expected to legalize online gambling before the end of the year.</p>
<p>So far, Pennsylvania and New York are the two states that look most likely to legalize online casinos in 2019. Both state legislatures have been amenable to the idea, and both have already passed bills that would allow regulated online gambling.</p>
<p>Other states that could legalize online casinos in 2019 include California, Illinois and Michigan. All three states have been exploring the possibility of legalizing online gambling in recent months, and all three appear to be close to passing legislation.</p>
<p>There is also some chance that Rhode Island could legalize online casinos in 2019. The state has been considering the issue for some time now, and there is growing momentum behind the idea of legalizing online gambling.</p>
<p>As for other states, it’s too early to say what will happen. Some states, such as Florida and Texas, remain hostile to legalized gambling and are unlikely to change their stance anytime soon. Other states, such as Indiana and Iowa, are on the fence and haven’t made any decisions yet.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s anyone’s guess as to which states will legalize online casinos in 2019. However, it seems likely that at least a few additional states will join Pennsylvania, New York and California in legalizing regulated casino games over the next twelve months.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Delaware-and-New-Jersey-Strike-Deals-For-Legalized-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Delaware-and-New-Jersey-Strike-Deals-For-Legalized-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey Strike Deals For Legalized Online Gambling"></a>Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey Strike Deals For Legalized Online Gambling</h1><p>Thursday, Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey announced agreements to legalize and regulate online gambling within their borders. The deal will allow people in those states to gamble on the internet, with some restrictions.</p>
<p>“This historic agreement marks a new chapter in the history of online gambling,” said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. “It will benefit our citizens and help to protect our state’s vital gaming industry.”</p>
<p>The regulation of online gambling has been a long time coming. For years, interested parties have battled over the issue of whether or not to legalize and regulate the activity. Thursday’s announcement signals that a consensus may finally be reached on the issue.</p>
<p>Details of the agreement are still being hammered out, but it is expected that each state will have its own regulatory framework governing how online gambling is conducted within its borders. This means that there may be some variation between the states in terms of which games are offered and how they are played.</p>
<p>One thing that is certain is that revenue generated from online gambling will be shared among the three states. This is good news for cash-strapped Delaware and New Jersey, both of which are facing budget shortfalls this year. Nevada stands to benefit as well, since it already has a well-established gaming industry.</p>
<p>So far there has been no word on when online gambling will actually go live in these states, but it is expected to happen sometime in early 2017. In the meantime, interested parties can start registering for accounts at authorized websites.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Enters-Race-To-Legalize-Online-Casinos"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Enters-Race-To-Legalize-Online-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Enters Race To Legalize Online Casinos"></a>Pennsylvania Enters Race To Legalize Online Casinos</h1><p>Pennsylvania is one of the latest states to jump into the race to legalize online casinos, and it could be a major boon for the state’s coffers.</p>
<p> Revenue from online gambling in Pennsylvania could top $500 million per year, and the industry would create thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>To date, only a handful of states have legalized online casinos, but that is likely to change in the coming years as more states see the potential revenue stream.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of the most populous states in the country, and it has been struggling to close a budget deficit. Legalizing online casinos could provide a much-needed infusion of cash for the state.</p>
<p>The move would also benefit casino owners and operators in Pennsylvania, who would be able to offer their services online. It’s estimated that there are currently around 12 million adult Pennsylvanians who gamble each year, so there is considerable potential for growth in this market.</p>
<h1 id="Could-These-Five-States-Be-Next-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Could-These-Five-States-Be-Next-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Could These Five States Be Next To Legalize Online Gambling?"></a>Could These Five States Be Next To Legalize Online Gambling?</h1><p>Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and California are all states that have recently entertained the idea of legalizing some form of online gambling.</p>
<p>The first state to consider legalizing online gambling was Pennsylvania. In October of 2017, the state Senate Committee on Gaming and Wagering held a hearing to discuss a bill that would legalize online casinos and poker. The bill passed the committee unanimously, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.</p>
<p>Illinois is also considering legalizing online gambling. A bill that would allow online casinos and poker passed the House of Representatives in April of 2018, but has not yet been voted on by the Senate.</p>
<p>Michigan is considering a bill that would legalize both online casinos and poker. The bill was introduced in February of 2018 and is currently pending in the House Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>
<p>In New York, a bill that would legalize both online casinos and poker was introduced in January of 2018. The Assembly Gaming Committee approved the bill in May of 2018, but it has not yet been voted on by the full Assembly.</p>
<p>California is also considering legalizing online gambling. A bill that would allow for both casino games and sports betting was introduced in February of 2018. The measure has since passed the Assembly Committee on Governmental Organization and is awaiting a vote by the full Assembly.</p>
<h1 id="California-Poised-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#California-Poised-To-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Poised To Legalize Online Gambling"></a>California Poised To Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the state of California is expected to legalize online gambling. The bill, AB 2863, was approved by the Assembly in a 57-18 vote last month and is now awaiting approval from the Senate.</p>
<p>The legislation would allow people in California to gamble on websites operated by licensed casinos. It would also allow for the establishment of a new regulatory body, the California Gaming Commission, which would be responsible for overseeing online gambling in the state.</p>
<p>Some critics of the bill argue that it does not go far enough in regulating online gambling. They argue that it does not require websites to identify players or enforce age restrictions. Others argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will help generate revenue for California’s cash-strapped government and create jobs in the gaming industry. They also argue that it will help protect consumers from scams and illegal activity.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would make California the latest state to legalize online gambling. Pennsylvania legalized online gambling last year, and New Jersey has been allowing online gambling since 2013.</p>
