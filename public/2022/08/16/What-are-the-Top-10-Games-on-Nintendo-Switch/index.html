Many would agree that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are some of the best games to come to the system.</p>
<p>But what makes these particular games so great? What sets them apart from all of the other games available on Nintendo Switch? Here is a closer look at why each of these ten games are considered the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>#1: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</p>
<p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is arguably the best game to come to Nintendo Switch. It’s a fighting game that features characters from various different Nintendo franchises, including Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid.</p>
<p>The game is incredibly fun and challenging, with online multiplayer support that allows you to battle players from all over the world. There are also tons of unlockables and special modes to keep you entertained for hours on end.</p>
<p>#2: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</p>

<h1 id="How-were-the-Top-10-Games-on-Nintendo-Switch-decided"><a href="#How-were-the-Top-10-Games-on-Nintendo-Switch-decided" class="headerlink" title="How were the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch decided?"></a>How were the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch decided?</h1><p>Nintendo has announced the top 10 games that were most played on the Nintendo Switch console in 2019. This announcement was made by Shinya Takahashi, the general manager of Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Division. </p>
<p>According to Takahashi, the games were chosen based on data collected from Nintendo Switch Online users. These users played through the games between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019. The list includes Rabbids Party Cruise at number 10 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons at number 1. </p>
<p>New Horizons was released on March 20, 2019 and sold over 16 million copies worldwide as of July 5th, 2019. It is also the fastest-selling game in Nintendo history. This may account for its high placement on the list. </p>
<p>While some of the games on the list come as no surprise, others are a bit more unexpected. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe came in at number 2 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at number 3. These two games have been incredibly popular since their release in 2017 and 2018 respectively. </p>
<p>Pokemon Sword and Shield came in at numbers 4 and 5. These games were released in late November of 2019 and have since sold over 6 million copies combined. Interestingly enough, this is lower than many other Pokemon games which is likely due to the backlash that the game received shortly after release. </p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild comes in at number 6 with over 15 million sales to date. Despite being available for nearly two years now, it is still one of the most popular games on the console. It’s likely that this will continue to be true for some time to come. </p>
<p> seventh place goes to Splatoon 2 with just over 10 million sales to date .This game was first released in 2017 but still proves to be a fan favorite among players .Just below it is Mario Party 10 which was first released all the way back in 2015 but still retains a decent player base . </p>
<p>Dragon Ball FighterZ takes ninth place with about 7 million sales .This game was released early in 2019 but its popularity has not dwindled yet . rounding out the top ten is none other than Cadence of Hyrule which is an interesting choice considering it’s a spinoff title that isn’t even a year old yet</p>

<p>According to them, it is a great honor to be included in this list. They feel that their games are among the best that the Nintendo Switch has to offer, and they are excited to see what the future holds for the platform.</p>
<p>They also credited Nintendo for creating a console that is both enjoyable and visually stunning. They believe that the Nintendo Switch has a bright future, and they are proud to be a part of it.</p>
<h1 id="Will-any-more-games-be-added-to-the-Top-10-Games-on-Nintendo-Switch"><a href="#Will-any-more-games-be-added-to-the-Top-10-Games-on-Nintendo-Switch" class="headerlink" title="Will any more games be added to the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch?"></a>Will any more games be added to the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch?</h1><p>Nintendo has announced the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch for the month of July. The list includes games like Super Mario Party, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2. However, there are some fans who are wondering if any more games will be added to the list.</p>
<p>There are some big games coming out in the near future that could potentially make it onto the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch list. games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Luigi’s Mansion 3 could potentially make it onto the list. These games are likely to be huge hits with gamers and could potentially knock some of the current games off of the list.</p>
<p>There are also a few other games that could potentially make it onto the list. These include games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. These games have been critically acclaimed and would likely do well on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>While there is no guarantee that any of these games will end up making it onto the Top 10 Games on Nintendo Switch list, they are all potential contenders. If you’re looking for a good game to play on your Nintendo Switch, then you should keep an eye out for these upcoming titles.</p>
