      		<h1 id="Which-Casino-Was-Army-of-the-Dead-Filmed-In"><a href="#Which-Casino-Was-Army-of-the-Dead-Filmed-In" class="headerlink" title="Which Casino Was Army of the Dead Filmed In?"></a>Which Casino Was Army of the Dead Filmed In?</h1><p>There has been some speculation on which casino Army of the Dead was filmed in.  Some people believe it was filmed in the Fremont Street area of Las Vegas while others believe it was filmed at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.</p>
<p>The answer is that Army of the Dead was filmed at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. This has been confirmed by both Zack Snyder, the director of Army of the Dead, and Joe Carnahan, one of the producers of the film.</p>
<p>Why was Army of the Dead filmed at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why Army of the Dead was filmed at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. First, the Rio is a large casino with plenty of space for filming. Second, the Rio is located close to downtown Las Vegas, which allowed for easy access to filming locations. Finally, the Rio provided a number of different filming locations, including its casino floor, pool area, and ballroom.</p>
<h1 id="Details-of-Army-of-the-Dead-Filming-Locations-Emerge"><a href="#Details-of-Army-of-the-Dead-Filming-Locations-Emerge" class="headerlink" title="Details of Army of the Dead Filming Locations Emerge"></a>Details of Army of the Dead Filming Locations Emerge</h1><p>As production for the highly anticipated movie Army of the Dead begins, details about filming locations are starting to emerge.</p>
<p>The zombie epic is set to be filmed in a number of exotic locations, including Croatia, Spain and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Zombie fans will be excited to know that much of the movie will be shot on location in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The city’s stone walls and ancient architecture are sure to lend an authentic feel to the film.</p>
<p>In addition, portions of the movie will be filmed in Madrid, Spain. The Spanish capital is no stranger to big-budget films, having served as a backdrop for blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<p>Army of the Dead is also set to film in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. These towering metropolises offer some of the most stunning backdrops in the world and should provide plenty of eye candy for zombie fans.</p>
<p>filming began january 13th</p>
<h1 id="Army-of-the-Dead-Filming-Spots-Finally-Revealed"><a href="#Army-of-the-Dead-Filming-Spots-Finally-Revealed" class="headerlink" title="Army of the Dead Filming Spots Finally Revealed!"></a>Army of the Dead Filming Spots Finally Revealed!</h1><p>Since the hit show “Army of the Dead” premiered on Netflix a few weeks ago, fans have been scouring the internet for any and all information about the show. However, up until now, no one has been able to find any filming spots for the show.</p>
<p>However, that changed earlier this week when someone who claimed to have worked on the show released a map of all the filming spots! The map includes locations in Los Angeles, Nevada, and even Hawaii!</p>
<p>While some of the locations are still under wraps, we at least know where most of the action is going to take place. So far, we know that there will be scenes filmed at The Grove in Los Angeles, The Strip in Las Vegas, and Waikiki Beach in Honolulu.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of Army of the Dead and want to catch a glimpse of your favorite stars in action, be sure to keep an eye on these locations!</p>
<h1 id="Who-Filmed-Army-of-the-Dead-in-a-Casino"><a href="#Who-Filmed-Army-of-the-Dead-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Who Filmed Army of the Dead in a Casino?"></a>Who Filmed Army of the Dead in a Casino?</h1><p>Army of the Dead is an upcoming zombie movie that was filmed in a casino. The zombie thriller stars Dave Bautista, known for his roles in Guardians of the Galaxy and Blade Runner 2049, and Ruby Rose, known for her roles in xXx: Return of Xander Cage and John Wick: Chapter Two.</p>
<p>The film is set in a world where zombies have taken over, and a small group of people are trying to survive. Army of the Dead is directed by Zack Snyder, who has also directed films such as 300, Man of Steel, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.</p>
<p>The cast and crew have been tight-lipped about the plot of the movie, but they have released some photos and videos from the set. In one photo, Bautista can be seen armed with a shotgun while Rose hides behind him. In another photo, the two are seen sitting around a campfire with some other actors.</p>
<p>Snyder has said that Army of the Dead is not a remake or reboot of George Romero’s 1978 classic zombie movie Dawn of the Dead. He has also said that it will be a “standalone” movie that can be watched without having seen any of his other films.</p>
<p>Army of the Dead is expected to be released in 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Used-for-Army-of-the-Dead-Filming-Finally-Identified"><a href="#Casino-Used-for-Army-of-the-Dead-Filming-Finally-Identified" class="headerlink" title="Casino Used for Army of the Dead Filming Finally Identified"></a>Casino Used for Army of the Dead Filming Finally Identified</h1><p>After a long and drawn out search, the casino that was used for the filming of Army of the Dead has finally been identified. The casino, which is located in Las Vegas, was used for a scene in the movie where the characters are trying to escape from a horde of zombies.</p>
<p>Army of the Dead was directed by Zack Snyder and released in 2008. The movie stars Josh Brolin, Ellen Page, and Ving Rhames. It is a zombie action movie that was filmed primarily in Detroit.</p>
<p>The casino that was used for filming has been identified as The D. However, the name of the casino was changed for the movie to avoid any legal issues. In Army of the Dead, The D is referred to as The Lucky Eagle Casino.</p>
<p>The D is a small casino located on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. It features just over 100 slot machines and a few table games. It is not one of the larger or more well-known casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, The D played an important role in Army of the Dead. In addition to being used for the scene where the characters are trying to escape from zombies, it also served as the location for some of the movie’s promotional material.</p>
<p>The casino has become something of a tourist attraction since Army of the Dead was released. Visitors can still visit The D and see where some of the iconic scenes from the movie were filmed.</p>
