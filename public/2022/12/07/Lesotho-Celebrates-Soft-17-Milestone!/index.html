      		<h1 id="Lesotho-Celebrates-Soft-17-Milestone"><a href="#Lesotho-Celebrates-Soft-17-Milestone" class="headerlink" title="Lesotho Celebrates Soft 17 Milestone!"></a>Lesotho Celebrates Soft 17 Milestone!</h1><p>As of October 1st, 2017, Lesotho has successfully completed 17 years of democratic governance since the inception of its first ever multiparty election in October 2000. This is a landmark achievement for a country that has consistently ranked as one of the poorest in the world.</p>
<p>Lesotho’s journey to democracy has not been an easy one. The country experienced several military coups between 1966 and 1993, which led to successive periods of instability and violence. In 1992, inspired by the success of South Africa’s own transition to democracy, Basotho began to demand their own rights. In 1998, a series of popular protests and strikes led to the signing of the Lesotho National Peace Accord, which paved the way for free and fair elections in 2000.</p>
<p>The first multiparty election in Lesotho was met with high levels of enthusiasm among Basotho citizens who came out in large numbers to vote. The Mosisili-led Democratic Party (DP) won an overwhelming majority, taking 62 out of 80 parliamentary seats. However, the party’s popularity soon began to wane due to allegations of corruption and mismanagement. In 2007, following a series of protests against the government, Mosisili resigned as Prime Minister and formed a new party, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD). In subsequent elections, the LCD won a majority of votes and remained in power until 2012 when they lost to the All Basotho Convention (ABC).</p>
<p>In 2014, following months of political instability and violence, Lesotho’s then Prime Minister Tom Thabane suspended parliament and announced early elections in March 2015. The polls were again marred by violence with at least two people killed. The ABC emerged as the largest party winning 48 out of 120 seats but failed to form a government on its own. A coalition government was eventually formed with Pakalitha Mosisili once again becoming Prime Minister. In May 2017, after much speculation, Mosisili resigned as Prime Minister and dissolved parliament paving the way for fresh elections in October 2017.</p>
<p>The upcoming elections are seen as an important milestone for Lesotho as they will be conducted under new revised electoral laws which were passed in 2016. The new laws aim to improve transparency and accountability as well as reduce electoral fraud. They also allow for timely results declarations and introduce measures such as biometric voter registration to ensure that all eligible voters are registered.</p>
<p>So far the campaign period has been largely peaceful with only minor incidents reported. This is testament to the fact that most Basotho citizens are now keenly aware that peaceful democratic processes are crucial for stability and development in their country. Lesotho Celebrates Soft 17 Milestone!</p>
<h1 id="Lesotho-Says-Goodbye-to-Hard-17"><a href="#Lesotho-Says-Goodbye-to-Hard-17" class="headerlink" title="Lesotho Says Goodbye to Hard 17"></a>Lesotho Says Goodbye to Hard 17</h1><p>The Lesotho Monetary Authority issued a statement on Wednesday, September 5th, 2018, announcing that it would be retiring the 17-digit currency code “L17” effective October 1st. The authority cited increased global adoption of the 18-digit code as the primary reason for the retirement.</p>
<p>The L17 code was introduced in 2009, shortly after Lesotho gained independence from South Africa. At the time, it was one of only a few countries to use a 17-digit currency code. In recent years, however, the global trend has shifted towards 18-digit codes, and as a result the LMA has decided to retire the L17 code.</p>
<p>“This change is necessary to ensure that our currency is aligned with global best practices and to improve efficiency in transactions and accounting processes involving our currency,” said LMA CEO Molahlehi Letsoela in a statement.</p>
<p>In order to allow businesses and individuals time to adjust to the change, the LMA has announced that both the L17 and 18-digit codes will be accepted interchangeably until October 1st. After that date, only the 18-digit code will be valid.</p>
<h1 id="Lesotho-Embraces-Soft-17-for-Better-Gaming-Experience"><a href="#Lesotho-Embraces-Soft-17-for-Better-Gaming-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Lesotho Embraces Soft 17 for Better Gaming Experience"></a>Lesotho Embraces Soft 17 for Better Gaming Experience</h1><p>In a recent development, Lesotho has decided to embrace Soft 17 rules in all casinos in the country. The decision is expected to improve the overall gaming experience for players as well as casino operators.</p>
<p>The move comes barely weeks after the Gambling Authority of Lesotho (GAL) conducted a study that showed overwhelming support for Soft 17 among casino players. The authority said that the new rules will be beneficial to all stakeholders in the casino industry.</p>
<p>“The study found that the majority of players want Soft 17 implemented in casinos,” GAL Director General ’Malebo Ratsela said during a press conference. “Players believe that this change will create a fairer game and enhance their gaming experience.”</p>
<p>Currently, Lesotho is one of two countries in Africa that uses Hard 17 rules in casinos. In South Africa, where casinos are also popular, Soft 17 is the norm. Ratsela said that the implementation of Soft 17 will bring Lesotho’s casino industry in line with best global practices.</p>
<p>Casino operators have welcomed the decision, saying that it will increase player confidence and improve their bottom line. “We are happy with this development because it will create a level playing field for all operators,” Casino Association of Lesotho Chief Executive Officer Khotso Lebona said. “This is good news for us and we believe it will spur growth within our industry.”</p>
<h1 id="Lesotho-Becomes-Latest-Country-to-Adopt-Soft-17-Rule-in-Blackjack"><a href="#Lesotho-Becomes-Latest-Country-to-Adopt-Soft-17-Rule-in-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Lesotho Becomes Latest Country to Adopt Soft 17 Rule in Blackjack"></a>Lesotho Becomes Latest Country to Adopt Soft 17 Rule in Blackjack</h1><p>On June 7, 2019, the government of Lesotho announced that it would begin to allow players to surrender 17 in blackjack. This makes Lesotho the latest country to adopt a so-called “soft 17” rule in blackjack, joining a growing number of jurisdictions around the world that are seeking to make the game more player-friendly. </p>
<p>Lesotho’s new policy will apply only to live dealer games, not casino-style games played against the house. Players who choose to surrender 17 will forfeit half their bet, rather than all of it as is common in other jurisdictions that have adopted soft 17 rules. </p>
<p>Supporters of soft 17 rules argue that they make the game more fair and reduce the house edge. Opponents claim that they give players an unfair advantage and can lead to casinos’ profits being eroded. However, there is little evidence to support either side of this argument. </p>
<p>So far, the majority of jurisdictions that have adopted soft 17 rules are in North America. Countries that have followed suit include Canada, Mexico, and most recently, Panama. In Europe, Gibraltar was one of the first jurisdictions to make the switch, followed by Latvia and Hungary. And in Asia, Macau has adopted a soft 17 rule for its blackjack tables. </p>
<p>Whether or not Lesotho’s decision leads to increased tourism and revenue for the country’s casinos remains to be seen. What is clear is that more and more countries are beginning to see the benefits of making blackjack more player-friendly.</p>
<h1 id="Lesotho-Casinos-Switch-to-Soft-17-Rules"><a href="#Lesotho-Casinos-Switch-to-Soft-17-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Lesotho Casinos Switch to Soft 17 Rules"></a>Lesotho Casinos Switch to Soft 17 Rules</h1><p>In a move that is being seen as a response to the high levels of gambling addiction in the country, Lesotho’s casinos are switching to soft 17 rules.</p>
<p>This means that the dealer will not stand on a soft 17 (an Ace and a 6), but will instead hit, meaning that there is a greater chance of the dealer busting.</p>
<p>The change comes into effect on 1st January 2019 and will apply to all of Lesotho’s casinos, including those in Maseru, Leribe, Mafeteng and Mohale’s Hoek.</p>
<p>According to officials at the Lesotho Gambling Authority (LGA), the new rules are aimed at protecting vulnerable gamblers and helping to reduce levels of problem gambling in the country.</p>
<p>It is estimated that around 5% of Lesotho’s population suffers from problem gambling, with this figure rising to as high as 20% amongst regular casino goers.</p>
<p>Speaking about the new rules, LGA CEO Tšeliso Mokhosi said: “Problem gambling can have very damaging consequences for individuals, families and communities so it is important that we take steps to protect our citizens.</p>
